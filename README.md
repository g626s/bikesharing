# Bikesharing
Created a data visualization story and dashboards for analysis of citi bike data using ETL methods in python to clean the data and Tableau for visualization.

## Project Overview:
The overview of this project incorporated a business proposal and pitch for citi bike for a particular group of potential investors. The goal and methodology of this project was to analyze the citi bike data that was collected in New York City on the month of August and launch a bike sharing business in Des Moines. The month of August was chosen specifically to analyze how the business operates in the peak of summer where tourisism is the highest. 
In order to convince and solidify the proposal to our potential investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is profitable, we implemented on creating a bike trip analysis for one key stakeholder. For this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we created an additional set of visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results 
For this part of the project, we created a story in Tableau and wrote our findings that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis.
